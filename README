I have truly enjoyed tinkering around with Apples Airplay technology and I use it quite a lot for my own setup.
Becuase of how much I use common features with airplay I decided to write a library that handles them.

AirFlick:
    This is a static function that when given an ip and url in the form (ip, url), it will send the url to the appletv at ip.
    Very little error checking is done as it is expected that you will handle this yourself with other classes in this library
Flickable
	Abstract class to be inhereted by classes that handle URLs for AppleTV
AirFile
	This class takes a file as input and startes a server with the mongoose module
	Includes:
		getURL()

Youtube:
    This class gets the appletv compatible urls from a youtube url
    Must pass the youtube.com url to the constructor: Youtube(url)
    Includes:
      getMP4s() - returns a list of format dictionaries all of format MP4
      getURL() - will attempt to select the highest quality video that is airplay compatible

findAppleTV:
    This class uses pybonjour to locate appletvs on the local network
    As soon as you construct this class it will begin searching the network asynchronously
    Includes:
		items()
		itervalues()
		iterkeys()
		iteritems()
		

AirplayControl:
    This is a class to handle the control of an appletv.  
    In order to work you must set the IP of the object with AirplayControl.ip or the constructor: AirplayControl(ip)
    Includes:
      pause() - pause the video on ip
      setRate(rate) - set the rate of the video on ip
      scrub(v) - scrub to the position v of the video on ip (currently does not work)
      play() - play the video on ip
      stop() - stop the video on ip

AppleTV:
	Class to control a specific appletv
	Subclass of AirplayControl so it can control appletv
	Includes:
		flick(Flickable) - send Flickable object to appletv or a


resolve_host:
    Static function that attempts to resolve the hostname given to an ip address.  
    Has optional timeout parameter

Example Usage:
	#first need to find appletvs
	f = findAppleTV()
	#findAppleTV() runs in the background so you need to give it a second to get results
	time.sleep(1)

	if len(f) <1:
		#this means no apple tvs...raise error
	elif len(f) >1:
		#this means more than one appletvs found...handle accordingly
	#there are several options here....here are a few
	1. for i in f: #findAppleTV is an iterable class
	2. if 'apple-tv-name' in f: #can test for hostname or ip with this statement
		atv = f['apple-tv-name']
	3. atv = f[0]

	print atv.hostname
	print atv.ip

	#next need to get a url...you could use any given url or try the Youtube class

	y = Youtube('youtube url')
	
	#Youtube is a subclass of Flickable which means it has a getURL() method

	atv.flick(y)
	
	#you can pass an object that is a subclass of Flickable with a getURL() method 
	#or you can just pass a string to the url
	
	f = AirFile('path to file')
	atv.flick(f)
