I have truly enjoyed tinkering around with Apples Airplay technology and I use it quite a lot for my own setup.
Becuase of how much I use common features with airplay I decided to write a library that handles them.

AirFlick:
    This is a static function that when given an ip and url in the form (ip, url), it will send the url to the appletv at ip.
    Very little error checking is done as it is expected that you will handle this yourself with other classes in this library

AirplayControl:
    This is a class to handle the control of an appletv.  
    In order to work you must set the IP of the object with AirplayControl.ip or the constructor: AirplayControl(ip)
    Includes:
      flick(url) - Send url to ip
      pause() - pause the video on ip
      setRate(rate) - set the rate of the video on ip
      scrub(v) - scrub to the position v of the video on ip (currently does not work)
      play() - play the video on ip
      stop() - stop the video on ip

Youtube:
    This class gets the appletv compatible urls from a youtube url
    Must pass the youtube.com url to the constructor: Youtube(url)
    Includes:
      getMP4s() - returns a list of format dictionaries all of format MP4
      getAirplayURL() - will attempt to select the highest quality video that is airplay compatible

findAppleTV:
    This class uses pybonjour to locate appletvs on the local network
    As soon as you construct this class it will begin searching the network asynchronously
    self.atvs is the internal list that stores the appletvs found thus far
    The items in self.atvs are of type AppleTV

AppleTV:
    Simple class to store the hostname and the ip of appletvs found by findAppleTV

resolve_host:
    Static function that attempts to resolve the hostname given to an ip address.  
    Has optional timeout parameter

Future Features:
    I plan to add a class that is an expansion of the AirFlick function can send a file to appletv and not just a url.
    The back-ends are basically the same you just need to host the file
    I like to use mongoose server but I have not figured out how to properly distribute it on github
